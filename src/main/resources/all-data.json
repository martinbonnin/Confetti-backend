      "description": "Applying Functional Programming practices in your code can quickly lead to heated debates: Hard-core FP advocates strive for the hegemony of 'functions everywhere,' whereas more conservative developers want to stay far away from the abstractions and complexity they add. The question is, who is right?\r\n\r\nDrawing on my rich experience with FP, I will share my learnings with numerous teams I have led and coached over the years with the quest to unleash the potential FP offers while avoiding the pitfall of blindly proclaiming functions as the silver bullet to everything. \r\n\r\nWith many live-coded examples, we will explore the benefits of various functional concepts, ranging from basic higher-order functions, function composition, and Monads rigidly focusing on practical problems they solve rather than getting lost in academic considerations. Along the way, you will get a line-up of all the functional features Kotlin offers as well as the goodies functional libraries such as Arrow have in store.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we want to create code that our colleagues love to maintain and extend, for which FP should be a friend rather than a burden. At the end of this talk, you will have the recipe for accomplishing this quest.\r\n",

But due to their versatile design, coroutines can also be helpful for tasks outside of concurrency.\r\n\r\nWe will deep dive into the implementation of coroutines in Kotlin and learn why their asynchronous execution is not a language feature. Sequence builders and deeply recursive functions from the standard library are prime examples of synchronous coroutines. You will learn how they work and strengthen your understanding of coroutine machinery.\r\n\r\nWe will look at the parser combinator library Parsus. It uses coroutines to make parsers debuggable without code generation and process data of arbitrary depth without stack overflow errors. You will learn how to build libraries using similar techniques and how to avoid various pitfalls when working with low-level coroutines APIs.",

This turned out to be the perfect solution -- and a major improvement over the most obvious alternative, Python's 'pandas.'\r\n\r\nWe'll walk through how I reduced reliance on SQL by about 80-90% and replaced it with a faster, easier, more flexible, integratable process based upon dataframe.

      "description": "Declarative UI frameworks encourage the creation of reusable components that can be used in different parts of the app. We all know that reusability is a good engineering practice but what often ends up happening is a little more nuanced:\r\n\r\n- As developers add new UI components, the codebase often ends up with hundreds of components that are hard to visualize.\r\n- Discovery is hard and there is no easy way to search for all your components. As a result, your codebase often ends up with duplicate components that offer similar functionality.\r\n- The same problems extend to other aspects of your design system like colors, typography, icons, etc.\r\n- In order to get around this, most mobile teams build their version of a “Component Browser” that lets you visualize your design system. This is often maintained manually with little to no tooling around it.\r\n\r\nIn order to solve these problems for our team and for the broader Android community, we (Airbnb) built and open-sourced Showkase. Showkase is an annotation-processor based Android library that helps you organize, discover, visualize and automatically screenshot test Jetpack Compose UI elements. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will dive deeper into how we used a KSP based system to solve the problems listed above. We will look into the internals of Showkase and how all this \"magic\" works. Lastly, we'll look at what to expect from the next few versions of Showkase and how we plan to extend it.\r\n\r\nGithub - [https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase](https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase)",

      "description": "Many social science researches use agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore the outcome of social mechanisms in hypothetical scenarios. Taking this one step further, it would be interesting to simulate interstellar societies. Under any interstellar scenario, physics tells us that we should at least consider special relativity. For example, there is a time delay constrained by the speed of light, and a moving agent experiences a time dilation effect. Since conventional simulation toolkits are not suitable for this specific scenario, we have created our framework in Kotlin, \"Relativitization\". We have constructed some models and a turn-based strategy game based on the framework.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will share our experience in utilizing Kotlin and its ecosystem for our social simulation framework. We try our best to keep this \"purely Kotlin\": kotlinx-coroutine for parallelization, kotlinx-serialization for copying/loading/saving data, dataframe for analyzing the output, ktor for the server-client architecture of the game, etc. Of course, sometimes it is unavoidable to rely on Java dependencies, like we choose libGDX for game GUI, and it integrates well with Kotlin. We believe our case shows that Kotlin is reasonably mature, performant, and user-friendly for social scientists who work in the discipline of social simulation.\r\n\r\n",

Then we'll build on that example by adding new product requirements to demonstrate how structured concurrency and lazy loading help us keep business logic and I/O separate.\r\n",

We need a way to write concurrent tests in a handy, declarative way, keeping in mind \"what to test,\" not \"how.\"\r\n\r\nAt JetBrains, we've developed Lincheck, a unique framework that makes writing concurrent tests a piece of cake. Users just need to list all the data structure operations, and Lincheck verifies whether these operations are thread-safe or not. In this talk, I will share how we use Linchek in Kotlin Coroutines, how to apply it to your setting, and briefly cover the framework internals.",

Additionally, the session will cover the tools we use to make this possible: an internal tool called \"Choice Expressions\" and an implementation of JsonSchema, both used to build UIs from a set of conditions.\r\n",

In software development we believe impossible things all the time, no matter the time of day! In this talk, however, we are going to take a look at six specific impossible things that shape the limits of what we can develop, all the way from the smallest detail of integer representation to the minefield of task estimation and prioritisation, via the uncertainty of distributed systems and the limits of computability. Once we know our limits, we can work within them to create solutions rather than problems.",

We will explore how it was originally inspired, the original goals and how its API evolved over time to support multiple platforms. \r\n\r\nA key goal of this side-project was to make it self-managed as much as possible with minimal overhead so that the open-source community can extend or maintain the library even in my absence. To achieve this I've incorporated a number of tools to upkeep standards from code contributions - tools such as Klover code coverage and binary-compatibility-validator. I've also used a number of automation tools to streamline the process of publishing a multiplatform library - tools such as GitHub actions build matrices to build and test on multiple platforms.",

What seemed to be impossible at first, was made possible by Kotlin and its Coroutines. It allowed us to reuse most of the existing code base and have a working prototype in a matter of days. Inter-op with Java really pays off!\r\n\r\nThe application is business-critical and processes billions of events per day in real-time with millisecond latency. It also used to burn a lot of $$ in the process, as a single instance of the application occupied a fairly large EC2 instance, running more than 1K threads and handling over 5K IOPS.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will walk through the process of using Kotlin to turn the app asynchronous and how we've integrated the coroutines stack, alongside (old) existing technologies. We will also show how this change made the application more efficient — yielding a 25% cost reduction, which translates into millions of $$ annually.\r\n\r\nWe will also cover challenges encountered along the way when doing such a change, like:\r\n\r\n- Low resolution telemetry data may hide bottlenecks\r\n- Asynchronous alone does not guarantee low latency\r\n- Unexpected impact on dependant services\r\n\r\n— so that you know what you are up against!",

In this talk we review some techniques that we’ve found effective at Google at detecting and preventing race conditions: static analysis and TSAN. First, a combination of interlocking static analyses allows flagging some potentially racy code at compile time based on heuristics. Second, we can leverage TSAN to detect race conditions when running (multithreaded) tests.",

      "description": "Real-world business processes typically grow a dense and complex network of processes, complimentary processes, sub-processes, and many dependencies between them. To optimize a business for profit, efficiency, or productivity, we need to disentangle its dense web of involved resources such as humans, methods, machines or material. Traditional business process modeling and simulation tools are mostly modeled as low-code environments. However, when a business is growing, these tools fail to scale and to deliver the required testbed for business process optimization and analysis. To overcome these challenges, I would like to introduce kalasim - an open-source MIT-licensed discrete simulation engine written in 100% Kotlin. \r\n\r\nkalasim https://www.kalasim.org is designed around suspendable coroutines for process definitions, and runs on the JVM for performance and scale. It ships with dependency injection, modern persistence, structured logging and automation capabilities. kalasim is now developed for more than 2 years, and has been battle-tested for modeling a sightly number of complex industrial business processes. kalasim is designed for simulation practitioners, process analysts and industrial engineers, who need to go beyond the limitations of existing simulation tools to model and optimize their business-critical use-cases. In contrast to many other simulation tools, kalasim is neither low-code nor no-code. It is code-first to enable change tracking, scaling, refactoring, CI/CD, unit-tests, and the rest of the gang that makes simulation development fun. \r\n\r\nThe presentation would be structured as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, I will introduce the key concepts of discrete event simulation with Kotlin and kalasim using some examples from https://www.kalasim.org/examples. We will discuss and learn how simulation entities are built on top of suspendable coroutines, and how to setup, configure, and run a simulation model.\r\n\r\nNext, we will study a more complex – but very visual - process simulation of a semiconductor wafer production process. I will demonstrate how to use kalasim in a jupyter notebook context, and how it seamlessly integrates with data-science libraries such as lets-plot and kotlin-dataframe. We will discuss how to optimize the modeled production process by modulating machine availability, staffing, and production planning.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will give an overview of how new users could start to model their own processes. I will share some experiences of how new users were onboarded into kalasim without having prior knowledge about Kotlin. Also, I will provide some pointers into more advanced features and integration capabilities of kalasim. \r\n",

      "description": "When making Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) it sure would be nice to use everyone's favorite language, but we also have to think about things like distribution and portability. While we can zip up our jars and assets, ask the user to extract them somewhere, and write a shell script to configure the JVM, classpath, and launch our Jar, there are also other options that allow us to write in Kotlin, while also building tools that look and feel just like any other on a user's system.\r\n\r\nWhen I first wrote Differ, a Kotlin Multiplatform library for image comparison, the sample app was a Kotlin JVM app like any other, which exercised the library by letting you provide two images for comparison and printing the results to STDOUT. It soon became apparent that the sample app would also make a useful CLI, but JVM based CLIs involve quite a bit of overhead to distribute and run. Since Differ is a multiplatform library, Kotlin Native was a straightforward solution to make a CLI written in Kotlin which looks and feels just like any other native tool on a developer machine.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll discuss situations in which Kotlin Native can be a great tool for building CLIs, some of the downsides of using Kotlin Native over other tools, and some of the tools and libraries that can help. Using real world examples, we'll explore how you can build, package and run CLIs just like other tools installed on your system. After this talk, you'll be prepared to use Kotlin Native to create your own useful, portable, and testable CLIs that work just like any other utility. ",
